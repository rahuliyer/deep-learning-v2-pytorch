    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model hyperparameters ####\n",
    "I started off with a pretty simple network with two layers. I didn't want to complicate the architecture early on and wanted the simplest model that would work. I chose 2 layers and embedding_dim set to 200. The reason I picked 200 was from the insights in the hyperparameters lecture. It said 200 was a good place to start. I set the hidden_dim to 300, a value between the embedding_dim and the output. Later I increased it to 500 to decrease the loss. This was a bit tricky since these were pretty close to how large I could make them given the memory on my GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training hyperparameters ####\n",
    "I picked a learning_rate = 0.01 and num_epochs = 40. These were arbitrary choices. However, when I trained this model, it did not converge with the loss oscillating at around 4.7-4.8. This indicated that I needed to decrease the learning rate. I set learning_rate to 0.001 and the loss started decreasing. However, I got the best stability at 0.0001.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these changes, 20 epochs was enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "64 was a batch size I picked arbitrarily. It worked quite well, so I didn't change it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data hyperparameters ####\n",
    "The sequence length I picked was 10. The reason for this was that when I plotted a histogram of the sentence lengths, about 65% of sentences were less than 10 words long (once the 0 length sentences were ignored). What I was going for here was that while producing each sentence, the previous sentence was what was used as the sequence. This seemed to work quite well in practice. I couldn't try much larger sequence lengths due to memory constraints, but in general, it seemed that a larger sequence length reduced the loss. Decreasing the sequence length to 5 didn't produce a training loss of < 3.5 in 20 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Validation loss ####\n",
    "I tried using the validation loss, but could never get it below 3.5. The model would always start overfitting around a loss of 4.5. This was despite a dropout of 0.5. Given this, there were 3 alternatives:\n",
    "1. Reduce the number of features\n",
    "2. Reduce the complexity of the network\n",
    "3. Get more data\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried reducing the size of the embedding dim (#1 above) and the hidden_dim (#2 above) but none of these approaches worked. I concluded that to get a lower validation loss, we'd need more data."
